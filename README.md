There are three projects:

One projects prints off the numbers 1-100, but replaces numbers divisible by 3
with a Zero, numbers divisible by 5 with Cool, and numbers divisible by both with ZeroCool.
Ex: 1,2,Zero,4,Cool,Zero,7,8,Zero,10,11,Zero,13,14,ZeroCool....

The second projects makes an API call getting JSONP and builds a widget using a document frag.

The third project is rebuilding the CSS/HTML site, with basic functionality.
At this point in the layout, it still needs some additional styles.
